# Feature Specification: Services Page with Pagination

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-light`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a light weight /services/+page.svelte page. The page already has filtering and search implemented, but it should be a small component like <Posts/ > with \`load more\` button. Only some refractoring and a few lines of pagenation code are needed. You can reference /posts/+page.svelte to see how logic is passed to the component."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24

- Q: What message should be displayed when user reaches bottom with no more services? ‚Üí A: "You reached" bottom message
- Q: How should error messages be displayed to users? ‚Üí A: Use toast() for error notifications
- Q: How many services should be shown initially? ‚Üí A: 9 services initially

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user browsing services, I want to load additional services with a "Load More" button instead of seeing all services at once, so that the page loads faster and I can browse services more efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user is on the services page with more than 9 services, **When** they scroll to the bottom, **Then** they see a "Load More" button to fetch additional services
2. **Given** a user clicks the "Load More" button, **When** additional services are loaded, **Then** the button updates to show loading state and then displays the next batch of services
3. **Given** a user has loaded all services, **When** they reach the end, **Then** the "Load More" button is hidden and a message indicates all services are loaded

### Edge Cases

- What happens when there are no more services to load?
- How does the system handle network errors when loading more services?
- What is the initial batch size of services to load?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display services in batches with a "Load More" button
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to continue using search and filter functionality while paginating
- **FR-003**: System MUST show loading indicators when fetching additional services
- **FR-004**: System MUST hide the "Load More" button when all services are loaded
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain current scroll position when loading more services
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle error cases gracefully when loading additional services
- **FR-007**: System MUST display "You reached bottom" message when no more services are available
- **FR-008**: System MUST display error messages using toast() notifications
- **FR-009**: System MUST initially display 9 services

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Service**: Represents a studio service with name, price, category, and metadata
- **Service Category**: Categories that services can be grouped by for filtering
