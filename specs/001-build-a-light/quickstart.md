# Quickstart: Services Page Pagination

## Setup
1. Ensure you have a development environment with Supabase configured
2. Make sure there are at least 10 services in the database to test pagination
3. Start the development server with `bun run dev`

## Testing the Feature

### Basic Pagination

2. Verify that only 9 services are displayed initially
3. Scroll to the bottom and click the "Load More" button

5. Continue clicking "Load More" until all services are loaded
6. Verify that the "Load More" button is hidden and "You reached bottom" message is displayed

### Search Functionality
