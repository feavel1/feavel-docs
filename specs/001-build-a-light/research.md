# Research: Services Page Pagination Implementation

## Decision

Implement pagination for the services page using a reusable `<Services />` component similar to the existing `<Posts />` component, with client-side pagination and a "Load More" button.

## Rationale

1. **Consistency**: Follows the existing pattern established by the Posts component
2. **Reusability**: Creates a reusable component that can be used in other parts of the application
3. **Performance**: Reduces initial load time by fetching only 9 services at a time
4. **User Experience**: Maintains existing filtering and search functionality while adding pagination
5. **Maintainability**: Follows established Svelte 5 runes patterns and Supabase integration standards

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Server-side pagination**: Fetch paginated data from the server instead of client-side pagination
   - Pros: Reduces initial data transfer, better for very large datasets
   - Cons: More complex implementation, requires backend changes, breaks existing filtering logic

2. **Infinite scroll**: Automatically load more services as the user scrolls
   - Pros: Seamless user experience
   - Cons: Harder to implement "You reached bottom" message, can cause performance issues with large datasets

3. **Traditional pagination**: Use numbered pages instead of "Load More" button
   - Pros: Familiar pattern for users
   - Cons: Doesn't match the existing Posts component pattern, more complex UI

## Best Practices Research

Based on the existing Posts component implementation:

1. Use `$state()` for reactive state variables (offset, loading, hasMorePosts)
2. Use `$derived()` for computed values (filtered posts)
3. Use `$effect()` for side effects (fetching data)
4. Use `range()` method for pagination in Supabase queries
5. Implement proper error handling with toast notifications
6. Maintain scroll position when loading more items
7. Show loading indicators during data fetch
