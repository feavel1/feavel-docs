# Research Findings: Studio System Implementation

## Technology Choices

### Decision: SvelteKit 5 with TypeScript

**Rationale**: The project already uses SvelteKit 5 with TypeScript, so we should continue with the same stack for consistency.
**Alternatives considered**:

- React with Next.js (would require significant refactoring)
- Vue with Nuxt.js (not used in current project)
- Plain Svelte (missing SSR benefits of SvelteKit)

### Decision: Supabase for Data Storage

**Rationale**: The project already uses Supabase for authentication and database operations. The studios table already exists in the database schema.
**Alternatives considered**:

- Direct PostgreSQL connection (already abstracted by Supabase)
- Firebase (different auth system than current project)
- MongoDB (document database vs. existing relational schema)

### Decision: shadcn-svelte for UI Components

**Rationale**: The project already uses shadcn-svelte components, so we should maintain consistency with existing UI patterns.
**Alternatives considered**:

- Custom CSS (would be inconsistent with existing design system)
- Other component libraries (would introduce inconsistency)

### Decision: sveltekit-superforms with Zod for Form Handling

**Rationale**: The project already uses sveltekit-superforms with Zod for form validation, so we should follow the established pattern.
**Alternatives considered**:

- Custom form handling (would be inconsistent with existing patterns)
- Other form libraries (not used in current project)

## Implementation Patterns

### Authentication and Authorization

**Decision**: Leverage existing hooks.server.ts for authentication and authorization checks.
**Rationale**: The hooks.server.ts file already handles authentication for /studio/dashboard routes with proper security checks, as mentioned in the user input. This eliminates the need for additional authentication logic.

### Data Access Patterns

**Decision**: Use event.locals.supabase for all database operations.
**Rationale**: Following the constitutional principle of "Supabase Integration Standards", all database operations must use the Supabase client provided by SvelteKit hooks.

### State Management

**Decision**: Use Svelte 5 runes ($state, $derived, $effect) for component state.
**Rationale**: Following the constitutional principle of "Component-Based Architecture", Svelte 5 runes should be used for state management.

### Component Structure

**Decision**: Follow existing modular component structure.
**Rationale**: Components should be placed in appropriate directories:

- UI components: `src/lib/components/ui/`
- Feature components: `src/lib/components/modules/`
- Pages: `src/routes/`

## Best Practices Research

### Svelte 5 Runes Patterns

Based on CLAUDE.md, the project uses these Svelte 5 patterns:

- `$state()` for reactive state variables
- `$derived()` for computed values
- `$effect()` for side effects
- `$props()` for component props

### Form Handling Patterns

The project uses sveltekit-superforms with Zod following this pattern:

1. Schema definition in +page.svelte module script
2. Server-side loading in +page.server.ts
3. Client-side implementation with superForm

### Supabase Integration Patterns

The project follows these Supabase patterns:

- Use `event.locals.supabase` in server code
- Use `event.locals.safeGetSession()` for auth checks
- Use `maybeSingle()` for optional single-record queries
- Implement proper error handling for all Supabase operations

## Technical Decisions

### Studio Application Process

**Decision**: Create a dedicated /studios/apply page for the application form.
**Rationale**: This provides a clear separation from the public studios listing page and follows common web application patterns.

### Dashboard Access Control

**Decision**: Implement limited dashboard access for "applied" status users.
**Rationale**: This provides immediate feedback to users while they wait for approval, improving user experience.

### Data Display

**Decision**: Display studios as cards on the landing page.
**Rationale**: Cards provide a visually appealing way to display multiple items with varying content lengths.

## Validation

All technical choices align with existing project patterns and constitutional requirements. No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers remain from the specification.
