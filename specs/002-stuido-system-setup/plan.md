# Implementation Plan: Studio System Setup

**Branch**: `002-stuido-system-setup` | **Date**: 2025-09-24 | **Spec**: /Users/feavel/Documents/Playground/Svelte/202507/feavel-docs/specs/002-stuido-system-setup/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-stuido-system-setup/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

This feature implements a studio system with three main components: 1) A public landing page at `/studios` displaying all approved studios as cards, 2) A studio application process where logged-in users can apply to become studios by submitting a form, and 3) A studio dashboard at `/studio/dashboard` with limited access for applied users and full access for approved users. The implementation will focus on UI/UX with simple queries following SvelteKit 5 and Supabase best practices.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript with SvelteKit 5
**Primary Dependencies**: Svelte 5, Supabase, shadcn-svelte components
**Storage**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
**Testing**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (E2E)
**Target Platform**: Web browser
**Project Type**: web
**Performance Goals**: Standard web application performance
**Constraints**: Follow existing SvelteKit and Supabase patterns, simple queries
**Scale/Scope**: Small to medium scale web application feature

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

Based on the Feavel Docs Constitution v1.1.0, this implementation plan must adhere to the following principles:

1. **Type Safety First**: All code will be written in TypeScript with strict type checking. Runtime type checking will be implemented for form inputs using Zod schemas.
2. **Component-Based Architecture**: The application will follow a modular component structure with UI components in `src/lib/components/ui/` and feature components in `src/lib/components/modules/`. Svelte 5 runes will be used for state management.
3. **Supabase Integration Standards**: All database operations will use the Supabase client provided by SvelteKit hooks. RLS policies already exist for tables. Server-side authentication will use `auth.getUser()`.
4. **Performance and Accessibility**: Queries will use `select()` to limit returned columns. Components will be accessible with proper ARIA attributes.

The plan adheres to all constitutional principles with no violations expected.

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) based on Technical Context indicating a web project with SvelteKit

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass
- Specific tasks for:
  - Create studio application form with Zod validation
  - Implement public studios landing page with card display
  - Create studio dashboard with navigation
  - Implement authentication and authorization checks
  - Create utility functions for studio operations

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)
- Data model and database integration first
- Public pages before protected pages
- Backend implementation before frontend

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
