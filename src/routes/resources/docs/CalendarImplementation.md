Setup:
main calendar page: src/routes/resources/calendar/+page.svelte
calendar modules: src/lib/components/modules/calendar/

1. Database Schema Design (COMPLETED)

- Created events table with PostgreSQL range types (tstzrange) as a single duration column
- Added exclusion constraints to prevent overlapping events for the same studio
- Added fields for event type (reservation, availability, seminar, etc.)
- Included status field for approval workflow (pending, approved, rejected, canceled)
- Linked events to services and studios
- Eliminated separate start_time and end_time columns in favor of a single duration column

2. Service Integration (COMPLETED)

- Created a new services_v2 table to support reservation types
- Added a field to distinguish between single download, reservation, and package delivery services
- Made service.description jsonb to support current text editor
- Created direct relationship between services and events (one-to-many: one service can have multiple events, each event belongs to one service)

3. Calendar component Implementation

- Create an EventCalendar component for detailed views (there is a demo in calendar/+page.svelte.demo)
- mock some data that will fit current supabase events table
- propose changes for database or
- Add the component to +page.svelte with mock data

<!-- 4. Reservation Workflow

- Implement a request/approval system for reservations
- Allow automatic confirmation for free events
- Enable studio owners to approve/reject reservation requests
- Support user cancellation and modification requests

5. Privacy & Access Control

- Show anonymous "busy" blocks on public calendars
- Display full details only to studio owners
- Implement proper RLS (Row Level Security) policies

Implementation Steps

1. Design and create the necessary database tables with range types
2. Implement backend utilities for event management
3. Create studio availability management interface
4. Build reservation request and approval workflows
5. Develop both studio-specific and public calendar views
6. Implement proper access controls and privacy features

Would you like me to proceed with any specific part of this plan? -->
